The data is generated using the [Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kerneler/starter-synthetic-jane-street-dataset-d7c7c87e-f) dataset from Kaggle and will consist of over 500,000,000 transactions with 30 features.

    " 1. **Generate a customer profile**: Every customer is different in their spending habits. This will be simulated by defining some properties for each customer. The main properties will be their geographical location, their spending frequency, and their spending amounts. The customer properties will be represented as a table, referred to as the customer profile table.\n",
    " 2. **Generation of terminal profiles**:  Geographical location  represented as a table, referred to as the terminal profile table.\n",
    " 3. **Relationship of customers to terminals**: The customer profile table will be joined to the terminal profile table to create a customer terminal relationship table. This table will be used to determine the location of each transaction.\n",
    " 4. **Generation of transaction data8**: The customer terminal relationship table will be used to generate the transaction data. The transaction data will be generated by randomly selecting a customer and terminal from the customer terminal relationship table. The transaction amount will be randomly selected from a normal distribution with a mean and standard deviation based on the customer profile. The transaction date and time will be randomly selected from a normal distribution with a mean and standard deviation based on the customer profile. The transaction type, status, category, description, and location will be randomly selected from a list of possible values.\n",
    " 5. **Generation of fraud data**: The transaction data will be used to generate fraud data. The fraud data will be generated by randomly selecting a transaction from the transaction data and changing the transaction status to 'REVERSED' and the transaction fraudulent flag to '1'."
