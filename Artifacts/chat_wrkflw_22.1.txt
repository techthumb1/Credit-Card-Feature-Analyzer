Data collection: Collect and store the data in a cloud storage service such as AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage. The data should include the independent variables that will be used to train the model and the target variable 'is_fraud' or 'not_fraud'.
Data pre-processing: Clean and pre-process the data to remove any missing or irrelevant information, and to ensure that the data is in the correct format for training and testing the model. This can include tasks such as handling missing values, normalizing or standardizing the data, and encoding categorical variables.
Anomaly detection: Use anomaly detection algorithms such as Local Outlier Factor (LOF) or Isolation Forest to identify patterns in the data that indicate fraudulent activity. The sci-kit learn library can be used to implement these algorithms.
Deep Learning: Use pre-trained neural network models such as Autoencoder or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to detect fraudulent transactions. Tensorflow or Pytorch can be used to implement these models.
Imbalanced data handling: Since the data is imbalanced, you can use techniques such as oversampling or SMOTE to handle imbalanced data.
Model interpretability: Use techniques such as LIME or SHAP to understand how the model is making its predictions.
Model training and evaluation: Split the data into training and testing sets, and use the training data to train the model. Evaluate the model using the testing data, and use metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to measure its performance.
Model deployment: Use a cloud-based service such as AWS SageMaker or Google Cloud ML Engine to deploy the model and make it accessible to the web application.
Web application development: Use the Flask framework to build the web application and connect it to the deployed model.
Containerization: Use Docker to containerize the application, and to prepare it for deployment on Heroku.
Deployment: Use Heroku to deploy the containerized application, and make it accessible to users.
Monitoring: Monitor the performance of the deployed model and system to ensure that it is working as expected and taking appropriate actions in case of any issues.

It's worth noting that this is a general workflow, and there may be additional steps or considerations depending on the specific requirements of your project. Additionally, as the data is very large, you may want to consider using distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark to process such large datasets.
